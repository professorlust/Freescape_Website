                    Probably the most "typical" of the Avantasian races by Human standards, the Dwarves of Avantasia prized fine metal and gemwork above all else. Art was made up of gemstone statues, grand murals of gilded metal finery, and fine decorative pieces of metal, stone and crystal.

                    Dwarven society is matriarchal, with women taking up ranks as everything from heads of household, to heads of State. Couples mate and marry for life. Men and women make up their military in equal number, which is the largest of all the Avantasian forces. Dwarves have weapon craft down to a fine art. They are especially proficient in the creation of instruments of war, both ranged and close quarters, and their military are amongst the best on the planet.

                    In Dwarven culture, it is common for many families to come together to form a "House". These Houses bonds are often strengthened through marriage. In Dwarven politics, when the old Queen dies, the strongest house can put forward their Matriarch for new Queenship, as succession does not guarantee anything. It is therefore common that the largest house receives the most votes, hence the reason why it is so important.

                    Dwarves are a short, stout race, with heights often ranging from between 4' and 5', with no discernible difference between genders. Males tend to grow beards, with red and brown being the most common hair colour. Eyes are often a muddy brown, though black is not uncommon. Dwarves live to around 110 years old.

                    Dwarves worship three Gods; The Crystal Mother, The Stone Father, and the Maiden of Metal. They represent the family unit that Dwarves hold so dear, as well as the minerals that brought them prosperity through their own endeavours.

                    The Stone Father, while being hard and rough, is the most easily shaped and malleable of the three. His wife and his daughter both having the ability to shape his emotion and guide him. He is the most temperamental of the three Gods, his mood swings are said to be the reason for tunnel collapses in mines. Initially he challenged the Crystal Mother to a battle to the death, but quickly found that he was no match for her. She gave him a choice. Stay with me, or die by my hand. He chose to stay, and vowed to cherish her forever.

                    The Crystal Mother is representative of the matriarch of Dwarven culture. She is beautiful, hard and perfect. She suffers no fools but is fair and a believer in second chances. She accepted the challenge of The Stone Father knowing she would win, and bringing him under her control. Prior to her doing this, it was said that rockslides were common, and volcanic magma spewed from the core of the planet. Now she has his temperament largely under control, and her people are safe once more.

                    The Maiden of Metal is the daughter that makes up the family unit. Her youth is represented by the relative malleability of metal compared to her parents. She encompasses the best of both of them, with a capability to be beautiful and deadly in equal measure.

                <p>
                    Dwarves scope the entire range of the alignment spectrum. While their society is a neutral one, males tend to lean towards chaos without a strong female to guide them, as they have a comparatively short fuse, balanced only by their deep respect for females of their race.

                    Dwarves are wary of most other races, with the exception of perhaps the Gnomes, for whom they bare a respect for their understanding of mining and the properties of metal and crystal. It is perhaps odd that these races get on so well, with Gnomes being so comparatively outlandish.

                    They harbour very little respect for Humans. Despite humans showing a change in their nature since arriving on Avantasia, the Dwarves find their treatment of their old planet abhorrent, and will not allow them access to their mines. Minerals are traded with humans via the means of very strict regulations, in exchange for new AMP tech units.

                    Elves and Dwarves have a troubled past. In ages past, great wars between the two races raged. While the creation of the Orcs allowed a shift in Elven culture, allowing them the luxury of glossing over their troubled past, the Dwarves are not so quick to forget.
