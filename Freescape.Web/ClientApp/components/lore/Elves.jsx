                <p>
                    The Elves admire beauty and grace in all things. This is reflected in their art, architecture, and their passionate pursuit of bio-engineering. Their cities are vast, symmetrical and crafted of fine stone and wood. They have adopted a classless culture, with each individual allowed and encouraged to pursue their passion, for a life well lived and enjoyed brings the most enrichment to the collective consciousness that makes up their afterlife.

                    Many Elves pursue aspects of the biological sciences, for to bring physical perfection to Avantasia is their greatest gift to it. Using complex and closely guarded secrets, they create new and beautiful species of flora and fauna, as well as exotic breeds of wildlife. It was this pursuit of physical perfection that led them to their greatest creation, the Orcs.

                    Schools, universities and other institutions of learning are commonplace among their cities, for in teaching and in learning, the Elves find their greatest happiness. Young Elves are encouraged to try their hand at a great many things at these institutions, so as to find a career later in life that brings true satisfaction.

                    They have a tendency to see themselves as superior to the other races of Avantasia, who do not share in their reverence of perfection, and therefore are not as close to it. This means that many of their kind are somewhat Xenophobic, and Elven society as a whole is somewhat introvert.

                <p>
                    Elves tend to range between 5' and 5'10", with males being slightly taller than females. They are generally slender and slight of frame, though more muscular body types are not uncommon. Eye colours are vivid, and they have no discernable pupil or iris, but rather the whole visible eye is one colour, with green, brown and blue being their natural colours. While Elves rarely tinker with their own DNA outside of medical practice, it was a fashion trend, particularly among younger Elves, to alter their eyes to red, purple and other colours. Their hair grows straight, with brown and black being the most common, and rarely, blonde. Elves age slightly more slowly than humans, reaching ages of approximately 150 years, though they reach maturity at a rate comparable to humankind.

                <h5 className="center">Religion</h5>
                <p>
                    While it is true that the Elven people worship no Gods, to say that they are not religious would be inaccurate. They believe that when a person dies, the energy that made up their consciousness does not dissipate, but stays whole. In essence, they believe that the individual's consciousness, and the memories, thoughts and experiences that make up a person remains intact, and simply shifts to a hitherto undetectable plane of existance. This collective joining of minds in death is known as the Nir'Alia, and joining it is believed to be an eternally blissful experience. While Elves do not fear death as a result of this, they cling to the importance of life, so as to be able to best enrich the Nir'Alia.

                    <br />
                    Because of this firm belief system, the Elves find the notion of the undead particularly abhorrent. They believe that even if the most base instincts (ie the need to find food and eat) are left behind, the Nir'Alia is receiving fractions of incomplete consciousness from what should be a whole person, and that their afterlife is being poisoned as a result.

                <h5 className="center">Alignment</h5>
                <p>
                    Elves tend to favour law and neutrality. With the belief that one day their entire life and experience will be shared with every Elf that was or will be, they try to live a life that will not bring them shame, as it is also believed that a toxic lifestyle is enough to see you banished from the Nir'Alia, to forever be alone with your thoughts in eternal nothingness.

                <h5 className="center">Relationships</h5>
                <p>
                    Elves do not tend to mix well with the other races. While they are not openly hostile, they see too much interaction with them as a hinderance to their personal goals of creating the beauty and grace of perfection in all things. While a few Elves are inclined to offer help to others to achieve their own perfection, this is often construed as arrogance and elitism by those not of Elvenkind. Elves do not like other races in their cities, and particularly not around their children. They see this kind of interference as a danger to the development of their offspring, and it is actively discouraged.

                    Their relationships with the Orcs, however, are quite different to the others. The Elves bio-engineered the Orcs to fulfill the more undesirable roles of their society. The soldiers, the manual labourers, the lowly assistants. This freed them up to pursue the more enjoyable and carefree aspects of life they have come to enjoy. While the Orcs were created with an in-built desire and longing to please their masters, the Elves see them as little more than machines; built to serve a purpose and disposable when the purpose is complete, or else they become too old or broken to serve it with efficiency.
