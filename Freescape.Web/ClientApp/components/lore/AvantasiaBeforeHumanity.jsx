                    Avantasia has a long and complex history behind it. The indigenous races have formed a cohesive existence, if sometimes a little on the rocky side. Each with it's own unique culture, they became specialists in a particular field; with trade, negotiation and occasional hostility seeing each race gained from others what they could not produce themselves.

                    The Elves, over many thousands of years, developed bio-engineering to a fine art. They revered beauty above all else, and their biological sciences allowed them to create some of the most astounding lifeforms through genetic manipulation. Songbirds capable of reciting entire works of the greatest Avantasian composers with precision. Flowers the size of vehicles in the most vibrant colours, with the sweetest of scents. Exotic pets and animals with no function other than to be beautiful. This obsession with beautification and perfection, as well as a desire to see all of Elvenkind granted the freedom to explore these elements of life, led to their creation of the Orcs almost 700 years prior to the arrival of humanity.

                    The Dwarves were a matriarchal, subterrainian society of miners and toilers. They appreciated fine craftsmanship and saw beauty in the mundane. In the right hands, a hunk of stone or metal could become something breathtaking. These were a people who valued the arts of war. While not openly hostile, they were ever ready to defend what they saw as theirs, and their temper balanced on a knife edge. They saw minerals and metals as gifts from their Gods to their peoples, and as such, regulation and control of it, in their eyes, was theirs.

                    The Halflings were true toilers. They worked their lands and revelled in the company of others after a hard day's work. Knowing the soil better than any, they were masters of agricultural technique, farming, and they knew the wilds better than any other race. Naturally inquisitive, they had the most time for any of their fellow indigenous.

                    Gnomes valued invention beyond anything. Their creations led down roads of discovery that many could only dream of. Faster modes of travel, weapons, industrial production; the sky was the limit for the Gnomes. They constantly worked closely with the Dwarves to aid them in their mining operations. A relationship of mutual benefit, as it in turn allowed the Gnomes free and easy access to the resources they needed to continue in their creative endeavours. Perhaps their most astounding credit though was the GenTec device.

                    The Avantasians mostly lived a cohesive life of dependence as a result of their finely tuned specialist fields. The only major scale war in recorded history, in fact, was four hundred years ago. It is believed that the war started in a disagreement between the Elves and the Dwarves. There was an arrangement between the two races, whereby the Elves were to create a new species of giant mole for the Dwarves, capable of mining on a previously unseen scale. In exchange, the Elves would receive a percentage of all of the resources that these creatures produced. Any Dwarf will tell you that the creatures were intentionally created infertile and with a shockingly short lifespan, and that the Elves did this intentionally to renegotiate when the creatures died. The Elves denied this claim, stating that the reason for the war was the Dwarves going back on their word, and not fulfilling deliveries as per the terms of the agreement.

                    The war was long and fierce, threatening to tear Avantasia apart. The Elves created Orcs on a huge scale, massive armies designed to combat the fiercely military inclined Dwarves. With the balance between the races being so delicate, it wasn't long before they were all fighting one another for the resources they so sorely needed.

                    The war raged for over eighty years. It was passed down through a generation, and at the make or break point, it was resolved. New measures were put in place, and the Silash Al Dur, or Council Of Four was born. From that point, all matters regarding interracial trade were regulated and controlled by the Council. An elected member of each of the Four Avantasian races (Orcs were not included) discussed and agreed upon by these representatives before any action was taken. The methods of electing a representitive were left to the races indvidually, and the system worked.

                    When humanity arrived, the Council voted on their right to stay. The vote was passed on a majority of three to one, with only the Dwarves voting against.
