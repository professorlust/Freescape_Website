                    Halfling society is one build around agriculture. They are the least technologically dependent race on Avantasia, and they are arguably the most in tune with the land. They live in towns, with little need for currency aside from trade with the other races, preferring to barter in goods and services instead. Halflings are great farmers and creators of exquisite foods. Their beers, wines and spirits are renowned.

                    The more adventurous of the Halflings learn about the wilds of Avantasia, taking forth their affinity for the natural world and applying it to gain understanding and mastery over the parts of their planet that are otherwise a dangerous place.

                    Their artwork consists mostly of tapestry depicting great landscapes, though artisty showing the importance of family and friends are also common. Architecturally, the Halflings build using wood and stone. Their dwellings are small, with farmlands on which to grow crops and raise livestock taking up most of their space. Gender plays no importance to Halfling society, as there are no biological differences in the strength, speed or intelligence between the sexes.

                    Halflings love to share in a good story, with poets, singers, writers and their ilk being the centre of any good party, of which the Halflings have many. They value the company of others, and love to regale in events gone by and toast to their achievements.

                <p>
                    Halflings, as their name suggests, are around half the size of a human. They range from around 2'10" to around 3'10" with no difference between the genders. They tend to have darker hair and eye colours. They are the shortest lived of all of the Avantasian races, with a Halfling reaching 65 being a rarity.

                <p>
                    Halflings worship Avantasia herself as their God. They believe that the world on which they stand created them, as it creates all that they need to sustain them. Natural disasters are a result of her displeasure, while a bountiful crop is her blessing. When a Halfling dies, they are never cremated, but always buried. It is important to a Halfling to be allowed to rejoin the cycle of creation in death. Because of this, the idea of animated remains are deeply upsetting to a Halfling, as the cycle is not complete until a body returns to the ground from which it came.

                <p>
                    Halflings lean more towards Good and Neutrality. They harbour a deep respect for their kin, with friendship and community being an important part of society. Therefore, all life on Avantasia is respected, as long as it shows respect in turn. Before the breakdown, Halflings displaying signs of Evil were banished from society, marked Gaddom, or "loner".

                    Halflings are the most commonly underestimated of the Avantasian races. Their lack of dependence on technology is construed as a lack of ability to create it, and therefore stupidity. Gnomes in particular find this strange, bordering on worrisome.

                    In contrast to this though, Halflings love the idea of learning about and spending time with anyone they can, regardless of race. As storytelling is such a big part of their society, they love to know all they can about their planetary neighbours. One thing that the other races do love about Halflings is their ability to create the most beautiful culinary delicacies on the planet. Their produce and ales are highly sought after in other communities, as no farmer or brewer has ever quite managed to match the skill of a Halfling master of the trade.
