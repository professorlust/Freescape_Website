                <p>
                    Orcish culture is built, by and large, around servitude to their Elven creators. Orcs were bio-engineered by the Elves to fulfill the less desirable jobs within their society, and, perhaps more perversely, were engineered in such a way that they want to do it. Their pleasure comes from the pleasure of their masters. They mostly have no art, craftsmanship or desires of their own.

                    <br />
                    The bulk of Orcish kind were built to serve the great cities of the Elves. They fulfilled roles such as soldiers, manual labourers, sewage workers and the likes. These Orcs show least personality beyond a desire to gain the approval of the Elves by being efficient at the tasks they are set by them.

                    Less commonly, an Orc was created to serve a particular Elf or Elven family. These Orcs were more broad in their range of ability, and far more personable when it came to their ability to interact. They were engineered this way so as to be able to meet the needs of their Elf on a wider spectrum, and put them more at ease by being far less autonomous than their public serving counterparts. In the event of their Elf dying, they became free to do as they desired, and while many chose to be imprinted to a new Elf, as they knew nothing else, some did venture out to find a life of their own.

                    Rarest of all were the failures. These Orcs were not created with that in built desire to serve, they did not seek the approval of the Elves, and they were as fully autonomous as any other race, free and able to pursue their own desires. Begrudgingly, they were allowed to do this by the Elves, on the condition that they left the Elven cities.

                <p>
                    Standing between 6' and 7.5', Orcs are a towering muscle wall to behold. Their skin is most commonly of a yellowish hue, as this was the colour selected for those Orcs who serve the States, though any colour is possible as they were created to the specifics of those who commissioned them. Greys and blacks made up the eyes, and many Orcs had prevalent tusks protruding from the mouth, though these did not impact speech. Orcs were created infertile, as their Elven engineers closely maintained watch of the traits and characteristics within each individual, and they felt that breeding in the traditional sense would introduce too many uncontrollable factors to that equation.

                <h5 className="center">Religion</h5>
                <p>
                    The Orcs largely revered the Elves as an almost Godlike entity. Their creators, they were made with an in-built desire to see them happy, on varying levels. While all Orcs were made with a powerful aversion to causing harm to an Elf, those who served the Elven States directly were made to go above and beyond for all of Elvenkind, while those commissioned privately only felt this to the Elf or Elves on which they were imprinted. This had the potential to cause a feeling of great loss and sorrow in an Orc, once it's master had passed. The Orcs who were created accidentally, without the desire to worship the Elves were free to choose a religion of one of the other races to follow if they so wished, though many did not, and instead remained a Godless entity, worshiping only the fact they have the freedom to choose.

                <h5 className="center">Alignment</h5>
                <p>
                    Orcs are mostly who they were made to be. Many are Lawful and Neutral, so as best to serve their Elven masters and fall in line with their tendancies. Some however, particularly the ones who were born free, adopt the full spectrum of alignment. Evil is just as common as Good in these individuals, as developing a bitterness at their situation, particularly geared towards the Elves, was not uncommon. Neither however was finding a fulfilling life among one of the more accepting races.

                    While most Orcs have an in-built respect for Elvenkind, studies have shown that in the prolonged absence of Elves and their instruction, Orcs will naturally develop a personality of their own, even when only a minimal one was imprinted to begin with. This means that, unless expressly told by an Elf to think a certain way about a particular race, they will form their own opinions. Unfortunately, due to the Xenophobic nature of the Elves and their tendency to talk openly in front of their Orc, these viewpoints are passively expressed and therefore shared by the Orc. This however, is not always the case.

                    Orcs are generally regarded with suspicion by the other races, though perhaps least so by the humans. While the Elves are confident in their creations, other races seem to assume an Orc is ready and willing to betray or harm them at any time, on the whim of their Elf. Humans have had the least amount of time to get to grips with this notion, and have not spent enough time around the Orcs to form an opinion.
