                    The human race is probably the most vast and varied on the whole of Avantasia. This is owing to the fact that instead of growing as one culture, back on Earth they divided into subcultures and pursued their own styles of art, architecture, tradition and even culinary preferences. Before coming to Avantasia, these cultural differences were far from celebrated. They caused fear, distrust, and even led to war. Humankind pillaged Earth for all it was worth in regard to natural resources, and fled the husk that was left in pursuit of a better home. A stroke of luck led to the discovery of Avantasia.

                    After settling, their fleet was decommissioned and re-purposed into the great city of New London. Attitudes changed amongst the humans, as the discovery of new races and civilizations shone a new perspective on a history of competition that spanned centuries. Humans were now one people, regardless of colour or religion, and they thrived on Avantasia. They settled into careers as traders, politicians, farmers, craftspeople and more. The variety of the old world was combined with a sense of unity that humanity had never felt on this scale and things were good. Renewable energy and sustainable farming took the place of fossil fuels and fracking, and a more cohesive and sustainable relationship with their environment was formed. Cityscapes became an amalgam of Earth's Eastern and Western styles, and artistic expression took on the same characteristics.

                    Humans are a varied bunch. They stand between around 5' to 6'6", with males being taller than females. Hair colours range from blonde, brown, black and red, though dyeing hair is a common practice. Eyes are most commonly blue, brown or green, though grey and other colours are not totally unheard of. Skin tones go from black to white, with many hues in between.

                <p>
                    Human religion back on Earth was largely based on locale. Some revered one God, some many and some none at all. It was a common theme with many human religions that there was a blissful afterlife awaiting for those who led good and wholesome lives, and eternal damnation for those who shunned righteousness. Many religions took it that these Gods were the creator of the world and the inhabitants of it, though it is also worthy of note that many humans disregarded all of these notions, and believed the universe was a result of scientific happenings.

                <h5 className="center">Alignment</h5>
                <p>
                    Humanity cover the whole scale of alignment. While the vast majority hover around the middle, getting on with their lives, there are some who dwell at the extreme ends. The human condition has the potential for extreme acts of good and kindness, as well as extreme acts of evil.

                <p>
                    Most humans had a lot of time for the other races, though their motivations for this varied wildly. Some pursued knowledge that the others held, while others sought to make profit from trading in cultural artifacts, while others still simply sought the companionship of them. There were portions of humanity, however, who flipped their internalized xenophobic attitudes onto the other Avantasians. Where they previously held an elitist attitude based on the colour of their own skin or locale on Earth, they now saw it as humanity vs. the rest. This minority, though, caused no major problems for the growth of relations between the locals and the newcomers.

                    Indeed, many humans could not fail to notice the similarities of the Avantasians to those races in the works of fiction of their own history. This is what led to the terms Elf, Orc, Halfling, Dwarf and Gnome being included in the human AMP translators when these races were referenced. Many of the Avantasians who were introduced to these stories were hard pressed to understand that they were not in fact historical records.

                    The decision to share AMP technology went a long way towards their general acceptance on the planet.
