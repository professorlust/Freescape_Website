                    The term AMP is derived from Neurophysical AMPlifier. The technology was developed initially by humans back on Earth, and it served as a means for people to better themselves both physically and mentally. The technology was originally used to help those suffering from physical and mental conditions; helping those in wheelchairs to walk again, and bridging the gaps in electrical activity in the brain, allowing those in comas to rouse once more. It was soon realised though that the AMP did more than just this. In those whom those early models were installed, huge spikes in intelligence, physical strength and dexterity were recorded. Further experimentation and development have seen AMP become what it is today: A device capable of boosting both the physical and mental aspects of those who use it to previously unthought of heights.

                    Perhaps the most shocking capability of AMP is that it can give users the ability to psionically change the physical world around them. With a thought, a user can heal wounds, cure disease, even teleport their physical body from one location to another. There were also military applications to these psionics, with users having the ability to change ambient temperatures and even static to create bolts of kinetic force. Though the creators of AMP called these abilities Psionic Enhancements, the general populace called them Magic, and that was the name that ended up sticking.

                    Some of the AMP abilities, most notably the "spells", required that the AMP recharge if they were used too frequently. The device did this itself, using surplus electrical energy from the brain, as well as via kinetic energy through movement. As this fuelled the "Magic", it was in turn christened "Mana" by users.

                    Physical enhancements were another function of the AMP, and they came just at the right time. When workforces were threatened to be replaced by machinary that had become so efficient that human labour had become obsolete, people could suddenly move faster, carry more, and endure harsher temperatures and environments thanks to AMP. As the technology was cheaper, many companies carried on with human workers over the more expensive mechanised alternative.

                    Of course these are only the most widely used applications. Many others exist.

                    When humanity arrived on Avantasia, AMP was pivotal in the decision to allow them to remain. The native races, while technologically advanced in their own unique ways, had never seen anything quite like it before. Humans and Elves worked closely together to allow AMP to be compatible with the unique physiology of each race, and a deal was struck which allowed humanity to remain. Once the races became more and more familiar with the technology, yet more programs for it were created to help with their unique needs. Now, AMP is a commonplace and versatile tool used by everyone in their day to day life.
