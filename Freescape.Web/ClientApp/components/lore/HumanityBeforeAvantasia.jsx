                    In 2046, the UN declared a state of planetary emergency. Earth as we knew it was gone; laid waste by decades upon decades of corporate greed. Natural resources were all but non-existent. Devastating earthquakes were frequent and deadly due to excessive mining and fracking. Air quality was the lowest it had ever been due to industrial pollution and deforestation, with diseases like emphysema, bronchitis and even cancer at record highs. Fossil fuels were almost entirely depleted, and without sufficient research into alternative sources, humanity had one option: Leave the planet, or become extinct. The entire human race pooled its resources into finding a viable way to achieve this goal. The world’s leading physicists worked on means of travelling the stars, engineers designed vessels suited to long-term accommodation of vast numbers of people, and what was left of the resources the dying planet had to offer were held to achieve this goal.

                    There was anarchy on the streets. With the sudden withdrawal of fuels, materials and resources, people went out of business; their ways of life having to change in dramatic ways to cope with this reversal of society. Many of the largest cities of the world became dystopic hellholes. Street gangs became prevalent, fighting for control. Law enforcement agencies couldn’t cope with the upheaval of society, and world leaders despaired for the fate of humanity, their warnings falling upon deaf ears, their endeavours, perhaps, too little too late. Those fitted with AMP technology ruled these times. Their bio-enhanced abilities making them virtually untouchable amidst the chaos.

                    The breakthrough that was to be the saviour of the species was made in 2055. Faster than light propulsion had been created and field tested. Construction on the vessels began immediately. Within eighteen months, a fleet of one hundred seventy three ships, each carrying twelve thousand passengers set a course into the great unknown. The rest of humanity was left behind, either unable to book passage, or unwilling to leave one hopeless situation for another…

                    Life on the vessels was difficult. Years and years of a dystopian Earth was carried forth onto these vessels, in smaller scale. Racial and cultural segregations were commonplace amongst the passengers, and the law enforcement officers aboard adopted a totalitarian attitude towards offenders. Fear reigned supreme, and those who fought too hard against it tended not to last long.

                    Humanity was thrown a lifeline once again, six years into their voyage. The lead vessel of the fleet, The Avant, experienced severe engine trouble and was forced to make an emergency landing on a Terrestrial Planet. Atmospheric scans checked out, and after some research, it was realised that this planet would make the perfect new home for humanity. It wasn’t long, however, until the other races made their presences known.

                    The planet was populated by several indigenous lifeforms, something that humanity, in its ignorance, had not wholly anticipated when they settled the fleet on a large continent in the northern hemisphere. These races, later christened Elves, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes and Orcs by the humans due to their similarities to the creatures of myth, lore and legend, were initially wary of the new visitors to their planet. After much negotiation, largely helped by the promise to share AMP technology with the aliens, humanity were allowed to settle upon the planet, known as Avantasia by the indigenous.
